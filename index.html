      <h2>Zoo Scrolling Effect</h2>
      <p>
        A zoo is a place where animals live in captivity and are put on display
        for people to view. Though people have kept wild animals for thousands
        of years, those collections have not always resembled modern zoos.
        <br />
        The word “zoo” is short for “zoological park.” Zoos contain wide
        varieties of animals that are native to all parts of the Earth. <br />

        Though people have kept wild animals for thousands of years, those
        collections have not always resembled modern zoos. <br />They left
        records of expeditions to distant places to bring back exotic animals
        such as giraffes, elephants, bears, dolphins, and birds. There is
        evidence that ancient zoo owners hired animal handlers to make sure
        their animals thrived and reproduced. The first zoos were created as
        private collections by the wealthy to show their power. These private
        collections were called menageries.
        <br />

        Wall carvings found in Egypt and Mesopotamia are evidence that rulers
        and aristocrats created menageries as early as 2500 BCE.
